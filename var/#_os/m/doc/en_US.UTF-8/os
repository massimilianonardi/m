m-os

is a portable and cross-platform operative system that can be installed natively as a standalone os, or on top of 
other operative systems (linux, macos, windows) as guest os.

install options:
- as virtual guest os into an host os (windows, macos or linux)
- as standalone os based on m-boot bootloader, linux kernel (stock, ubuntu, debian, kali, ubuntu studio, etc.), 
  custom initramfs, m-shell (text-ui + gui)
- as navi (native + virtual) folder/image that can be booted from a virtual machine engine (vmware, qemu, etc.) 
  with persistence or booted natively

how to install:
  host: portable storage with bootable m-os preconfigured to start the full installer for 
        other devices (partition, copy, install m-os, configure boot, etc.)
  guest: from a preinstalled or portable instance of m-net-store (standalone m guest os with electron+java)
  guest: host-os specific installer or self-extracting archive to download and extract sources and 
         execute installer from sources
  guest: manual download and exctract of archive with installer for every host-os that then 
         executes universal installer
  guest: command line to execute = wget/curl download self extracting script + piped to 
         sh -> extract minimal copy + execute guest universal installer
  guest: from host-installed-git with a git clone command
