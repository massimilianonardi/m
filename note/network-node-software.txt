NET NODE SOFTWARE:

everything must be integrated into m-os and thus available also as standalone portable application

best: c/c++ compiled sunaptos node cross-platform (node is at the same time server and client + support for other clients (web, etc.))

easy: java server with https connector + web client (browser or electron/nwjs)
web client api and web connector interface must resemble sunaptos phylosophy

net command > net ui > net-fs fuse > net-fs kernel mod

NB private key must be on server node, so if user want to carry with him/her, then he/she must carry the whole node (pri-key + node)

PRACTICAL DESIDERATA:

initially file are used for upload directly from filesystem, cache is minimal
initial net should be kad, or at least interact with it
initially it will promote as kad indexing system and use both nets but most files are on kad
helper applications to import offline or in real time from web content (eg wikipedia, imdb)
internal kad and bt client
