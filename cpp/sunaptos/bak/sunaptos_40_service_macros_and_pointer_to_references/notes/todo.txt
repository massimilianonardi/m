exception on configurable output/logger, rethink whole structure particularly based on sequence
make base Service default function "f" call the virtual overloaded version (implemented by specific srv implementation) surrounded by new try/catch macros, same thing for srv creation
system namespace and modules namespaces parametric
dynamiclibrarymanager use the shared pointers tecnique
system log based on streamoutput with loglevel etc.
system debug based on system log?
system advanced buffer derived from buffer construct, copy and cast to/from basic data types and operator[] -> no
sequence derived from advanced buffer? -> probably no
rethink service interface
revise streams
enforce const methods and enforce passing variables by const reference to allow temporaries construction
cross platform system gui class as external srv
Object with a to_string() virtual method
